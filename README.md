# IndicSynth
*A Large-Scale Multilingual Synthetic Speech Dataset for Low-Resource Indian Languages*

**🏆 Outstanding Paper Award, ACL 2025**

---

## 🧠 Overview

**IndicSynth** is a novel multilingual synthetic speech dataset designed to advance multilingual **audio deepfake detection (ADD)** and **anti-spoofing** research. It covers **12 low-resource Indian languages** and provides both **mimicry** and **diversity** subsets.

> 4,000+ hours of synthetic audio  
> 12 languages: Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Odia, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu  
> Useful for ADD, speaker verification (SV), and bias studies

## 📂 Dataset Structure

Each language folder contains:

<pre>
    
IndicSynth/
├── Bengali/
│ ├── audio/ # All .wav files (synthetic clips)
│ └── metadata.csv # Metadata for all synthetic clips
├── Gujarati/
│ ├── audio/
│ └── metadata.csv

</pre>

Each 'metadata.csv' includes:

- Generative Model (xtts_v2 / vits / freevc24)
- Speaker IDs
- Gender
- Transcript (if applicable)
- File path to synthetic audio


📝 **Note on Transcripts in Metadata**

The transcripts included in the metadata.csv files represent the intended text prompts used during synthetic speech generation via TTS models. We provide these transcripts to enable future explorations, but do not guarantee perfect alignment with the generated audio. If you intend to use IndicSynth for speech-to-text or similar tasks, we strongly recommend conducting careful human evaluation with proficient native speakers of the respective languages.

## ⚙️ IndicSynth Generation?

Synthetic data was generated using:

| Model      | Type      | Transcript | Fine-Tuned |
|------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| xtts_v2  | TTS       | Yes        | Yes (for 10 languages) |
| vits     | TTS       | Yes        | No          |
| freevc24 | VC        | No         | No          |

> **Mimicry subset**: For anti-spoofing research

> **Diversity subset**: Contains diverse set of realistic synthetic voices for multilingual audio deepfake detection research

## 📦 Access the Dataset

**HuggingFace:** https://huggingface.co/datasets/vdivyasharma/IndicSynth

You can load a specific language using:

```python
import os
import soundfile as sf
from datasets import load_dataset

language = "Hindi"
ds = load_dataset("vdivyasharma/IndicSynth", name=language, split="train")

# Output directory
output_dir = language
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Loop through dataset and save each clip
for example in dataset:
    audio_array = example["audio"]["array"]
    sampling_rate = example["audio"]["sampling_rate"]
    
    # Extract original filename
    original_name = example.get("file") or example.get("path") or example.get("audio")["path"].split("/")[-1]
    
    # Save to disk
    sf.write(os.path.join(output_dir, original_name), audio_array, sampling_rate)
```
